The project is a simple web application for managing events. The web application allows users to create, view, update and delete event information.

Key features include:

Adding new events indicating the name, description, date and time, location and organizer.
View a list of all events with basic information about each.
Ability to edit existing events to update information.
Removing events from the list.
The web application is built using Node.js for the backend, Express.js for creating the API, Pug for page templates, and Axios for communication between the client and backend. The JSON file system is used to store event data.

The project demonstrates the basic principles of creating web applications and can be used as a basis for further expansion and development
